## Project-Specific Notes

### What This Project Demonstrates About Me

1. **Quick Learning**: Learned Next.js 14 App Router, Anthropic API, and Brave Search API in < 48 hours

2. **AI Proficiency**: Effectively used Claude to accelerate development while maintaining code quality

3. **Production Mindset**: 
   - Added health checks
   - Implemented error handling
   - Created comprehensive documentation
   - Used environment variables for secrets

4. **User Experience**: Designed intuitive UI with loading states, error messages, and helpful guidance

5. **Code Quality**:
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Clean component architecture
   - Reusable utility functions
   - Consistent naming conventions

6. **Problem-Solving**: Integrated multiple APIs (Search, AI, Scraping) into cohesive workflow

### Time Breakdown (Total: ~6 hours)

- Research & Planning: 30 minutes
- Setup & Configuration: 30 minutes
- Core Development: 3 hours
- Testing & Debugging: 1 hour
- Documentation: 1 hour

### Challenges Overcome

1. **API Rate Limits**: Implemented efficient batching and caching strategies
